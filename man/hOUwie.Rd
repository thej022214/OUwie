\title{Fit a joint model of discrete and continuous characters via maximum-likelihood.}
\description{
The hOUwie model jointly estimates the likelihood of a discrete and continuous character by combining the probability of the continuous character given a particular regime and the probability of that discrete regime painting, integrated over many regime paintings. Specifically, we combine hidden Markov models of discrete character evolution (Beaulieu et al. 2013; Boyko and Beaulieu 2021) with generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models (Hansen 1997; Butler and King 2004; Hansen et al. 2008; Beaulieu et al. 2012; Ho and Ane 2014a). 

This function takes as main input a phylogenetic tree and a data.frame containing species, character values, and potentially measurement error. The rate category is a way to specify the number of hidden states to be incldued, with one meaning no hidden states present. The structure of the model and association between discrete and continuous characters is specified via discrete_model and continuous model (see Details).}

\item{n_starts}{An integer, specifying the number of trials for fitting the model, using alternative (randomized) starting parameters at each trial.

\details{
This model is composed of two processes: one that describes the evolution of a discrete character and the other describes the evolution of a continuous character. To model the evolution of a single continuous character we use an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model (Hansen 1997; Butler and King 2004; Hansen et al. 2008; Beaulieu et al. 2012; Ho and Ane 2014a). This model combines the stochastic evolution of a trait through time with a deterministic component which models the tendency for a trait to evolve towards an optimum. In this model, the value of a trait, \code{X_t}, is pulled towards an optimum, \code{theta}, at a rate scaled by the parameter \code{alpha}. The optimum, \code{theta}, is a piecewise constant on intervals and takes values in a finite set \code{theta}. This can represent the set of "selective regimes", "regimes", or Simpson's "adaptive zones" (Cressler et al. 2015), though it is consistent with a variety of true underlying microevolutionary models (Hansen 2014). Additionally, random deviations are introduced by Gaussian white noise dB(t), which is distributed as a normal random variable with mean zero and variance equal to \code{sigma^2}. Thus, \code{sigma^2} is a constant describing the rate of stochastic evolution around the optimum. We use the set of extensions introduced by Beaulieu et al. (2012). This allows for multiple primary optima \code{theta} in which both the pull strength (\code{alpha}) and the rate of stochastic evolution (\code{sigma^2}) can vary across the phylogeny. 

This model allows for multiple rate categories (specified by the rate.cat argument). The default is one rate class in which only observed discrete states evolve. However, there are two main reasons one may be interested in increasing the number of rate categories. First, rate heterogeneity throughout the tree of life is more of a rule than a possibility. Not all things will evolve in the same way at the same time. For example, woody and herbaceous plants may evolve one way on the mainland and a completely different way on island. The challenge then is to allow for heterogeneity in the evolutionary process when we do not know what the 'mainland' or 'island' variables are. This is what hidden Markov models allow us to do (Boyko and Beaulieu 2021). The second reason to include hidden rate categories is to reduce the error rates of finding a false correlation. This has been discussed elsewhere in depth (see Maddison and FitzJohn 2015, Uyeda et al. 2018, Boyko and Beaulieu 2022). The problem lies in if we compare models with rate heterogeneity to models without it. Most character dependent models (correlation models) allow for different ways for the characters to evolve. In fact, their reliable inference depends on being able to define the differences between, for example, body size evolution on islands and mainlands. However, most character-independent models have no way to allow for variable ways for body size to evolve. So, whether or not the evolution of body size is connected to island systems, we may be biased towards selecting correlation models simply because they allow body size to have different rates of evolution. 

It is not uncommon to map a discrete character on a phylogeny using a model of evolution for that discrete character and then run various continuous trait models using that mapping (or a stochastic set of these mappings), and OUwie has ways to use such mappings. However, that mapping is completely uninformed by the continuous trait -- it could be that a nearly identical mapping fits the continuous trait far better. A different approach is to do the regime detection using the continuous trait only, as in SURFACE or OUwie.dredge. But if there is a reasonable discrete character (perhaps with hidden states), it can make the most sense to get the likelihood integrating across all different discrete mappings, summing the likelihood for the discrete and continuous traits while doing so. Because looking at all possible reconstructions is infeasible, and looking at them from a distribution from stochastic mapping biases it towards discrete-only mappings, we approximate this by summing over a large number of potential mappings centered on those that seem a good fit to the data.

One way that hOUwie differs from other implementations of automatic regime detection is that we explicitly calculate the the probability of discrete characters (D) and stochastic mapping (z). The difficulties of calculating the pathway probabilities explicitly are outlined in Boyko et al. (2022), but ultimately led us to use an approximation. This approximation relies on a finite number of degree-2 internodes and uses the standard Chapman-Kolmgorov equation to calculate the probabilities of beginning in a particular state i and ending in state j (Pagel 1994) and is identical to a joint probability of a set of state reconstructions (Yang 2006). 

\code{discrete_model} defines the model between discrete states. This option controls the number of independent rates and the correspondence between independent and dependent rates. If a character, then it must be one of "ER", "SYM", "ARD". If an integer matrix, then it defines a custom parametric structure for the transition rates, by mapping entries of the transition matrix to a set of independent transition-rate parameters (numbered 1,2, and so on). All cells with the number 3 represent transitions that have the same estimated rate. Additionally, ambiguities (polymorphic taxa or taxa missing data) are assigned likelihoods following Felsenstein (2004, p. 255). Taxa with missing data are coded \dQuote{?} with all states observed at a tip. Polymorphic taxa are coded with states separated by an \dQuote{&}. For example, if a trait has four states and taxon A is observed to be in state 1 and 3, the character would be coded as \dQuote{1&3}. Missing data are treated as ambiguous for all states, thus all states for taxa missing data are assigned a likelihood of 1.0 (some software may incorrectly assign a likelihood of 1.0/number of possible states; note this if comparing likelihoods). For example, for a four-state character (i.e. DNA), a taxon missing data will have likelihoods of all four states equal to 1.0 [e.g. L(A)=1.0, L(C)=1.0, L(G)=1.0, L(T)=1.0].

\code{continuous_model} option controls the number of independent continuous model parameters and the correspondence between continuous model parameters and underlying regime. If a character, then it must be one of "BM1", "BMV", "OU1", "OUM", "OUA", "OUV", "OUMV", "OUMA", "OUVA", or "OUMVA". These correspond to allowing theta ("OUM"), sigma_square ("BMV", "OUV"), or alpha ("OUA") to vary. If an integer matrix, then it defines a custom parametric structure for the transition rates, by mapping entries of the continuous model parameters to the states of the underlying regimes. Note that when some taxa have phenotypic values below 0, we add 50 to all continuous trait values to assist the optimization, but the estimated parameter values will be scaled back to the original values.

For each set of parameters evaluated during the maximum likelihood search, a set of stochastic mappings are generated to evaluate the discrete and continuous likelihoods. To do this efficiently, we first approximate of the conditional state probabilities at nodes. This is what happens if \code{sample_nodes=TRUE}. The conditional state probability, unlike the more common marginal reconstruction or joint state reconstruction, calculates the probability that a node has a particular state value conditioned only on the observations of its descendants. For a particular focal node, we calculate the probability of the observing all pairwise descendant values given the OU model parameters, integrated over all possible rootward node states, and observed tipward discrete states. This process is repeated for each iteration of parameters if \code{adaptive_sample=TRUE}, in which case it is repeated until the joint likelihood for a given set of mappings does not improve. We recommend that both of these arugements are set to TRUE for character independent models because it is often very difficult to generate mappings based soley on a discrete process that are good when the discrete character is predicted to be unlinked to the continuous character (i.e., when you're fitting a character independent model). In the case of a character dependent model, the continuous and discrete character are expected to influence one another and actually basing maps on the discrete character only (setting sample_nodes and adaptive_sampling to FALSE) can work fairly well.

The algorithm used to calculate the likelihood described in Beaulieu et al. (2012) involves matrix inversion -- a computationally costly procedure. Therefore, we implement a linear-time computation of the likelihood of Gaussian trait models following (Ho and Ane 2014).
